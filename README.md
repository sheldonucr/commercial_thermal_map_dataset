# thermal_map_database
 
This repository holds the datasets to train spatial thermal distribution prediction models for chips such as RealMaps, ThermalGAN, and ThermalTransformer. Data is collected on CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs. The input is the chip performance metrics, and the output is the thermal map.
